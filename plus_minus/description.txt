The purpose of this program is to learn how to demenstrate how to work with arrays and deal with decimal precision:
In this program I wrote a function that takes an array as a parameter and with that array it finds out how many 
positive, negative, and numbers that are equall to zero that are in the array.  After it has done that it does
some math to find out what ratio each of the above zero numbers, below zero numbers, and numbers equall to zero are
compared to the total number of numbers in the array.  It then prints out that number to 6 decimal places of accuracy
